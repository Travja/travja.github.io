                        <p>My name is Travis Eggett, I am 17 years old and a senior in high school. I am the second oldest in a family of 8 people. I have been programming since I was 12 and have always loved it. Throughout my life, I have always had the mentality that I am responsible for my own well being, not anyone else. Because of this mentality, I have a strong work ethic to get any job I am presented with done quickly and efficiently.</p>
                        <p>As far as entertainment goes, I enjoy playing video games and playing my saxophone. When I was presented with the opportunity to be a part of the Elementary Band in 6th grade, I was super excited. I started on the clarinet, but quickly switched to the alto saxophone and have been playing that since. I am in the advanced jazz band and the top concert band in my school.</p>
