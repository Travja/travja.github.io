                            <p>I have only worked at a few places, but I have always been doing something on the side. When I was 9, I ran an incubation business. I would have people bring me various types of eggs and I would incubate and hatch them. After that, I did some scroll saw for an organization called BACA. And then I picked up programming. This has been one of the most constant things since. I started off with basic HTML and CSS and then found Minecraft and quickly dived into Java development.</p>
                            <p>After learning Java and plugin development, I picked a variety of different freelance jobs and made some money there. Eventually, I found a server network called NirvanaMC. I worked with them for two years now.</p>
                            <p>Now as far as official work goes, I have only worked at a couple places. The first place that I worked was Trafalga in Lehi. I was a park attendant and was in charge of operating rides and ensuring that the facilities were well kept and presentable for guests. I quit after working there for six months because the pay was not that great and the work environment was not professional enough for what I wanted.</p>
                            <p>So then after not having a job for about six months, I got a job as a custodian at American Fork Junior High. I worked from January to the end of May, 2016. I came in after school each day and helped make sure that the school was clean and presentable for the students the next day. My specific job was to clean bathrooms.</p>
                            <br />
                            <p>After serving a mission for 2 years, I returned home December of 2019. I'm ready to get out and work!</p>

                            <p>I have received a few different rewards for my accomplishments in school. One of which was basically Student of the Year for my school district in 6th grade. The other was a recognition of my work ethic and positive attitude the same year.</p>
                            <p>Also in 6th grade, I was a part of the student council. We ran school assemblies and motivated the school to perform better and have fun. We also had various duties like doing morning announcements and collecting recycling from each class.</p>

                            <p>My name is Travis Eggett, I am 21 years old and a freshman in college studying Computer Science. I am the second oldest in a family of 8 people. I have been programming since I was 12 and have always loved it. Throughout my life, I have always had the mentality that I am responsible for my own well being, not anyone else. Because of this mentality, I have a strong work ethic to get any job I am presented with done quickly and efficiently.</p>
                            <p>As far as entertainment goes, I enjoy playing video games and playing my saxophone. When I was presented with the opportunity to be a part of the Elementary Band in 6th grade, I was super excited. I started on the clarinet, but quickly switched to the alto saxophone and have been playing that since. I am in the advanced jazz band and the top concert band in my school.</p>
                            <p>Since then, I have graduated high school, and went on a mission for my church. I am back home now and going to college, studying Computer Science and hoping to make a career out of it. I've always loved computers and the opportunities they present. It's a passion of mine for sure. I am basically my family's tech support.</p>

                <p>I was a part of Nirvana's development team for about 2 years. I worked on various projects, including their Crusade Kit PvP. I was the lead developer there. It was a great work environment and I learned a lot. I left there to serve a mission for my church where I went to Washington State to teach people about the gospel.</p>
                <hr>
                <h3>Just a couple things you should know</h3>
                <p>I have always sort of had the mentality that I am responsible for the work I put myself in and I will do my best to get the job done quickly and efficiently. I have been complimented on my work ethic by coworkers, friends, managers, and family. Even if I may not like what I am tasked with, I don't let that stop me from doing a good job and getting it done. After all, what is complaining going to do for me? The job needs to get done one way or another and the easiest way is the one that doesn't involve slacking off or complaining.</p>
