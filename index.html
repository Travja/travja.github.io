                        <p>I have only worked at a few places, but I have always been doing something on the side. When I was 9, I ran an incubation business. I would have people bring me various types of eggs and I would incubate and hatch them. After that, I did some scroll saw for an organization called BACA. And then I picked up programming. This has been one of the most constant things since. I started off with basic HTML and CSS and then found Minecraft and quickly dived into Java development.</p>
                        <p>After learning Java and plugin development, I picked a variety of different freelance jobs and made some money there. Eventually, I found a server network called NirvanaMC. I have been working with them for two years now.</p>
                        <p>Now as far as official work goes, I have only worked at a couple places. The first place that I worked was Trafalga in Lehi. I was a park attendant and was in charge of operating rides and ensuring that the facilities were well kept and presentable for guests. I quit after working there for six months because the pay was not that great and the work environment was not professional enough for what I wanted.</p>
                        <p>So then after not having a job for about six months, I got a job as a custodian at American Fork Junior High. I worked from January to the end of May, 2016. I came in after school each day and helped make sure that the school was clean and presentable for the students the next day. My specific job was to clean bathrooms.</p>

                        <p>I have received a few different rewards for my accomplishments in school. One of which was basically Student of the Year for my school district in 6th grade. The other was a recognition of my work ethic and positive attitude the same year.</p>
                        <p>Also in 6th grade, I was a part of the student council. We ran school assemblies and motivated the school to perform better and have fun. We also had various duties like doing morning announcements and collecting recycling from each class.</p>

                        <p>My name is Travis Eggett, I am 17 years old and a senior in high school. I am the second oldest in a family of 8 people. I have been programming since I was 12 and have always loved it. Throughout my life, I have always had the mentality that I am responsible for my own well being, not anyone else. Because of this mentality, I have a strong work ethic to get any job I am presented with done quickly and efficiently.</p>
                        <p>As far as entertainment goes, I enjoy playing video games and playing my saxophone. When I was presented with the opportunity to be a part of the Elementary Band in 6th grade, I was super excited. I started on the clarinet, but quickly switched to the alto saxophone and have been playing that since. I am in the advanced jazz band and the top concert band in my school.</p>
